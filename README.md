# Surfs Up Weather Analysis


## Overview of the challenge

This analysis will help us determine the viability of doing a business venture in Hawaii. We want to start a surf store but our main investor is worried about the weather conditions for the store location. Below we will present a summary of our findings.

The average temperature difference is of 4°F, 75°F for June and 71°F for December. 
The highest temperatures for both months are similar, 85°F for June and 83°F for December but the lowest temperatures do have a bigger diference, 64°F for June and 56°F for December.

Even though there are soime differences in temperature, I wouldn't worry to much about it and proceed with the business venture with no problem. But if I could choose, I would suggest opening the store in June.
